\problemname{Job DNA}
During hundreds of years, people have been dissatisfied with their jobs.
Maybe they were too boring, too difficulty or simply not just right for some reason.
After much research, JobAgent has successfully modelled how good you are at a job using a circular string of length $N$, your so-called ``job DNA''.
Each possible job can be identified with a text string of length $M$.
How good you are at a job can then be measured as the largest number of \emph{non-overlapping} occurrances of the string in your job DNA.
JobAgent wants to use your job DNA to find the job that fits you the best.
Can you find the text string for the job that fits you the best?

\section*{Input}
The first line of the input consists of two integers $N$ and $M$ ($2 \le M \le N \le 10^6$), the length of the job DNA string and the length of the string that a job can be identified with.

The second and final line contains a string with $N$ characters \texttt{a-z}, the job DNA you should find the best job for.
Note that this string is circular, so that the last character in the string is immediately followed by the first one.

\section*{Output}
Output the length $M$ string that occurrs the most times.
If there are several such strings, output the lexicographically smallets one.

\section*{Scoring}
If you solve the problem fully, you get $2$ points.

To get $1$ point, you only need to solve the problem for cases where $N \le 5\,000$.
