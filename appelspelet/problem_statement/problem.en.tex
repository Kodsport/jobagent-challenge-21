\problemname{The Apple Game}
Alf and Beata have a very long garden in which $N$ apple trees grow in a long line.
Each summer, the trees become filled with apples.
They then play a game with the trees.
In the game, Alf and Beata take turns picking all the apples from three trees which are separated by exactly one tree, i.e. from the trees $i$, $i + 2$ and $i + 4$ spots from the leftmost tree for some $i$.
Such a move is only valid if none of the three trees had their apples picked from them in a previous move.
A player without a valid move on their turn loses.
Given $N$, can you determine if Alf or Beata wins the game if Alf moves first?

\section*{Input}
The input consists of a single integer $N$ ($5 \le N \le 1\,000\,000$), the number of apple trees.

\section*{Output}
If Alf (the first player) wins, output \texttt{alf}.
Otherwise, output \texttt{beata}.

\section*{Scoring}
If you solve the problem fully, you get $2$ points.

To get $1$ point, you only need to solve the problem for cases where $N \le 1\,000$.
